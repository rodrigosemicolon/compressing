# compressing
Repository containing simple implementations of various compressing methods (still wip, barebones implementations first, optimizations later).

To run the compressors, compile and run with: 

    -comp <file_to_compress> <compressed_destination> 
    
    -decomp <file_to_decompress> <decompressed_destination>
